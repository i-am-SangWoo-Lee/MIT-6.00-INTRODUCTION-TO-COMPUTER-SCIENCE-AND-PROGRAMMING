# COURSE DESCRIPTION
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably 

## Instructors:

## GOALS
This subject has several related goals: 
 Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
Help students, including those who do not necessarily plan to major in Course VI, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
Position students so that they can compete for UROPs and excel in subjects such as 6.01.
